# Traffic light

## Description
Design a crosswalk traffic light using the top row of LEDs.   
Use an 8x8 matrix display to show the pedestrian signals and a seven-segment display for the countdown (countdown during the red light phase). The modes are as follows:

A. Daytime:

1. Round 1: Green light for 12 seconds, with a walking green signal.
2. Round 2: Flashing green light for 3 seconds, with a running green signal.
3. Round 3: Flashing yellow light for 5 seconds, with a flashing yellow signal.
4. Round 4: Red light for 20 seconds, with a static red signal.


B. Nighttime: Flashing yellow light, with a flashing yellow signal and the seven-segment display showing 0000.
